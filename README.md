# PyGimbal

## Abstract

This project will interface with a project I am also working on called ArduGimbal. The RaspberryPi 3 B+ will be the main processing and brains for the gimbal. The gimbal as a whole will be user programable to travel and follow points in space that the user choses with a web-based application.

## Required Features

- API Communication with Arduino via GPIO pins
- Web-based control interface. Website will be served up by connecting to Raspberry Pi directly via Wi-Fi.
